KaPoW Plugin for DokuWiki

This plugin implements Proof-of-Work spam blocking for wiki editing.
Based on the work of Tien Le, Ed Kaiser, Wu-chang Feng, Portland State
University (http://www.thefengs.com/wuchang/work/).

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/kapow/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
